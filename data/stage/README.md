# Data Staging Directory

This directory serves as a temporary location for data that is in the process of being loaded into the system before further processing.

## Purpose

The staging directory is used for:

- Temporary storage of data uploads before validation
- Landing zone for automated data ingestion
- Holding area for data that requires validation before processing
- Isolation of potentially malformed data

## Data Format

Data in this directory may appear in various formats:

- Original source formats (CSV, JSON, XML)
- Archive files (.zip, .tar.gz) pending extraction
- Malformed data awaiting correction
- Unvalidated data files from external sources

## Usage

The staging directory is primarily accessed by:

- Data ingestion pipelines
- Validation scripts
- File monitoring services
- Data quality gates

## Notes

- Data in this directory is highly transient
- Files should not remain here for extended periods
- Automated cleanup processes may remove older files
- Naming convention for staged files:
  - `{source}_{data_type}_{timestamp}_staging.{format}`
  - Example: `spotify_export_20230101120000_staging.json`
